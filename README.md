## Project Description
This project aims to practice the CRISP-DM process for a real dataset for the first time. The CRISP-DM process shows how to understand the data, how to process the data and how to address the busniess questions using data science concepts.

## Library
This project used the **numpy** , **pandas** for data preprocessing; **matplotlib**, **seaborn** for visualization; **sklearn** for creating train, test set and linear regression models.

## Project Results
This project addresses three busniess questions:
1. Which features influence the property price? [Neighbourhoods,Bedroom numbers for each property,Cancellation Policy and Pricing, Property Type]
2. Is the superhost acting well compared with other people? [Superhost performs better in responding within a hour compared with other]
3. Could you predict the housing price with your choice?[Yes, the linear Regression was applied to predict the price however the results shown in the R square is not good]
